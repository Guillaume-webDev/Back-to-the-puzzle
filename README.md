#2 What is it?
This is a game I made as my first project after joining the Web Development IRONHACK bootcamp.

What was the goal?
The goal was to make a "race car" like game that would run and deploy in a browser. All made with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

Why this one?
I would like to say it was after a lot of thinking but it would be a lie, the Alien going home just popped in my head and I thought it would be cool so I just went for it! The title takes after the movie quote Mi casa, tel√©fono - ET.

Features
A very cute alien.
Challenging difficulty
LOTS of randomness
Multiple canvas animations
Issues
Phantom collisions sometimes.
Demo
Alien Mi Casa
